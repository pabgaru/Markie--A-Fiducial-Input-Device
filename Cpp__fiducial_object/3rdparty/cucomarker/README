The cucomarker library is a opensource implementation of the research work:

"Design, Detection, and Tracking of Customized Fiducial Markers", D Jurado-Rodríguez, R Muñoz-Salinas, S Garrido-Jurado, Rafael Medina-Carnicer, IEEE Access vol 9, pages 140066-140078, year 2021

It allows you to create customizable markers (like Aruco, but with your own design). It has been designed
to be portable. A single header file (cucomarker) is all you need to include it into your own project.


Procceed as follows:

1) Follow the tutorial on how to create marker template. You need a SVG editor (like inkscape).
  As a result, you will obtain a .svg file with your model design, indicating the bits employed for data and
  for CRC along with the colors they have.

2) Use the program printmarker to obtain the different markers from your template. If your template has for instance
4 data bits, it means you can create up to 2^4=16 different markers. The printmarker program needs to read
svg files, which requires the use of 3rdparty programs (tinyxml2 and plutovg). This depedency is only required for this
program, but does not need to be in your own project.  The printmarker program generates a png image of your markers you
can print, and also a configuration file in YAML format that can be read with OpenCV later.

3) In your own project, include the header file cucomarker.h and do as in the example program markerdetector.cpp
The program reads the  YAML marker configuration  file and images and will detect markers in the image.
Since cucomarker.h only depends on OpenCV, you can easily integrate it into your project without additional messy
dependencies.

Cheers!
